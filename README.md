## Description
   -  This project was created to analyze certain stocks from 2018-2020 <3
  Each Sheet within the excel document was analyzed separately. Four columns were created Ticker, Yearly change, Percent change and total volume.
  Yearly change column shows the change from the open to close price in each corresponding year.
  Percent change is based off the yearly change, divided by the opening price. Total volume is the sum of each stocks yearly volume.The ticker column is   the corresponding stock. I also created a section for functionality, showing the greatest percent increase, decrease and total volume. This section can be used to compare which stock did the best and worst in all three years.
